# RingoJS

Ringo is a JavaScript platform built on the JVM and optimized for server-side applications.
It's based on the Mozilla Rhino JavaScript engine.

It adds a number of features to Rhino that make it suitable for real-world,
large-scale application development:

  * A fast, auto-reloading, and CommonJS-compliant module loader.
  * A rich set of modules covering I/O, logging, development tools
    and much more.
  * Support for blocking and non-blocking I/O.
  * Scalable HTTP server based on the Jetty project.
  * Support for CommonJS packages to install or write additional software
    components.
